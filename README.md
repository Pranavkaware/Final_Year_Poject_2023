# Final_Year_Poject_2023
Our project addresses challenges in prosthetic development by creating a remote tool for measuring hand dimensions. It uses distance measurement and image-based methods for precise customization. Leveraging OpenCV, TensorFlow, Tkinter, Mediapipe, and NumPy, it enhances accessibility, accuracy, and efficiency in prosthetic hand design.
